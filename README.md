### Predicting Churn Using Random Forests

This project explores customer churn prediction using decision trees and random forests, two powerful machine learning algorithms for classification. The primary objective is to analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that contribute to churn. By predicting churn, businesses can proactively retain at-risk customers and improve customer satisfaction.

Another key goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of decision trees and random forests while extracting meaningful insights from them. Since this is a learning-focused project, I will include detailed explanations of each step, including the intuition behind the techniques used.
